    "I am certainly not a statistics expert. However, within VSI together with Jelle, Ann-Katrin and Kristof Bruiyn, we are involved in scientific callaborations that deal with large data. I am talking about collider experiments, collecting huge volumed of data, direct dark matter detectors, such as XENON, and cosmological observables, such as the cosmic microwave background. I myself am involved in the [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org/), [CCAT observatory](https://www.ccatobservatory.org/) and [REACH](https://www.reachtelescope.org/). To infer cosmology we typically rely on so-called Bayesian inference (sneakpeak in lecture 2), which in a nutshell assigns probabilty to all degrees of freedom, e.g. the model, the data and the parameters. There is some reason for this which we can (will) discuss. Traditionally in particle physics the statistical inference is based on frequentsist analysis, although of-late Bayesian inference is also applied more often. We will explain the difference between these during the course. "

    "Relevant to cosmology is the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/) at the **Vera C. Rubin Observatory**. LSST will generate roughly **200 PB** of imaging data over its 10-year mission. Every three nights it will re-image the entire southern sky, measuring well over 100 properties for some **40 billion** objects.  Here are some early example [images](https://rubinobservatory.org/news/first-imagery-rubin) after only a few days of data.\n",

Euclid is mapping billions of galaxies in optical and near-infrared bands to study dark energy, dark matter, and the geometry of the Universe.  Euclid first-light [images](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid/Euclid_s_first_images_the_dazzling_edge_of_darkness).\n",

It will consist of thousands of dishes and over a million antennas spread across South Africa and Australia. At peak, SKA will generate **~1 exabyte of raw data per day**, exceeding the total current daily global internet traffic.\n",

    "In **particle physics**, the data volumes are even more extreme. At the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), the detectors observe up to **40 million collisions per second**. Because storing all collisions is impossible, experiments rely on **trigger systems**, which are layers of fast decision logic that determine which events are recorded for further analysis (roughly 1 in 100,000). \n",

    "One of the four major LHC experiments is [LHCb](https://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/), which specializes in the physics of **beauty (b) and charm quarks**, precision tests of the Standard Model, and measurements of **CP violation**. LHCb also records enormous data volumes and recently upgraded to a triggerless readout at 30 TB/s. LHCb event images: https://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/en/EventDisplay/.\n",

    "Another important particle-physics experiment is the [XENON](https://xenonexperiment.org/) series of detectors (XENON1T, XENONnT), which are among the world’s most sensitive experiments searching for **dark matter** via the scattering of hypothetical particles like WIMPs off xenon nuclei. These detectors observe tiny flashes of light and ionization inside massive liquid-xenon time projection chambers. Such experiments also collect PB of data. \n",

Since this course is heavily based on lectures by Davide Gerosa and Stephen Taylor, please feel free to navigate to those courses on the web as well. Those courses however also include machine learning and are aimed at MSc students. In addition, these courses are heavily skewed towards astronomy. In notebooks, I have tried to replace examples that are overly astro with similar examples from particle physics and cosmology.

    "Applying probability theory to real data is an important LO of this course.  One does not understand how to treat scientific data by only reading equations on the blackboard: you will need to get your hands dirty. Students are required to come to classes with a laptop or any device where you can code on (larger than a smartphone I would say...). Each class will pair theoretical explanations to hands-on exercises and demonstrations. These are the key content of the course, so please engage with them as much a possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will run through the notebook and provide some derivations on the blackboard here and there. At the end of each lecture, there is an assignment which requires some coding based on stuff we have done during the lecture. These assignments can be completed during the tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are practical lab sessions where you'll be asked to immediately apply the techniques you have just seen. So, open your jupyter notebook and have fun! The TA's will be able to help and otherwise you can ask me. That being said, I am not a python expert (fortran is my native language) so I might not be able to answer all your questions. However, you are allowed to use help from LLM's. As long as you make sure you understand the outcome (so for LLM generated code I want the student to explicitly comment all lines of code and explain what the code is doing -- while you can ask the LLM to do that for you, it is usually incomplete). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a physics course, we also will have to do some calculations with pen and paper. We will have a short entry exam each tutorial. These will be graded and can count towards your final grade (max 10%), but only if they help improve your grade will they count. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the final 2 weeks of the course you will be asked to work on a group assignment and write a report. This assignment will count for 40% of your grade. Finally, there will be a 2hr written exam. This will count for 50% of your final grade. The exact content of the written exam has to be determined. \n"

What I really like about that book is that they provide the code behind each single figure: [astroml.org/book\\_figures](https://www.astroml.org/book_figures/). The best way to approach these topics is to study the introduction on the book, then grab the code and try to play with it.  Make sure you get the updated edition of the book (that's the one with a black cover, not orange) because all the examples have been updated to python 3. The figures use some formatting which was not working in the version of Python I was using, so I have tried to fix this to the best of my ability in the notebooks.

    "For this course we can use google colab, which is a free to use environment that works in your browser (but can also work in Visual Studio).

    "\n",
    "At some point in your research you'll need to run python code on your laptop. I guess most of you have done it already for earlier classes (if so, how many?). It might take a bit of effort to set it up, but sooner is better than later. \n",

    "If you have trouble installing python on your laptop, I'm happy to help as I can. I don't have personal experience with Windows but I was told that getting the [Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows) is now the easiest way. \n",
